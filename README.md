Flutter basic implementation for Classical Bluetooth.

Based on [flutter_blue](https://github.com/pauldemarco/flutter_blue).

The first goal of this project is making an interface for Serial Port Protocol (HC-05 Adapter).

This plugin needs a lot of improvements, so I need your help. Any kind of collaboration will be awesome.
