  // Note by PsychoX at 2019-08-19 while working on issue #60:
  // Fixed and then tested whole thing multiple times:
  // - [X] basic `connect`, use `output`/`input` and `disconnect` by local scenario,
  // - [X] fail on connecting to device that isn't listening,
  // - [X] working `output` if no `listen`ing to `input`,
  // - [X] closing by local if no `input` written,
  // - [X] closing by local if no `listen`ing to `input` (this was the #60),
  // - [X] closing by remote if no `input` written,
  // - [X] closing by remote if no `listen`ing to `input`,
  //    It works, but library user is notifed either by error on `output.add` or
  //    by observing `connection.isConnected`. In "normal" conditions user can
  //    listen to `input` even just for the `onDone` to proper detect closing.
